# Bank_Market_Analysis & Term Deposite Prediction
This project explores a bankâ€™s customer data to analyze customer profiles, understand key patterns, and predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit. Leveraging a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models, this project demonstrates advanced data science techniques relevant for optimizing marketing campaigns and improving customer acquisition strategies.

# Project Objectives:-
1) Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in customer demographics and their interactions with the bank, identifying significant attributes influencing customer behavior.

2) Feature Engineering & Selection: Create new features from raw data and apply feature selection methods to identify the most impactful variables for prediction.

3) Model Development: Build multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to classify customers based on their likelihood of purchasing a term deposit.

4)Model Optimization: Use hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance model performance, aiming to optimize accuracy and other performance metrics such as F1 Score, Precision, and Recall.


# Key Highlights:-

1) Data Handling and EDA:
   Analyzed features like Age, Job, Marital Status, Education, Balance, Loan History, and Campaign Details. Visualized distribution and relationships among features, handled outliers, and managed missing data to prepare for model training.

2) Feature Engineering:
 Created valuable features based on interactions and historical data, utilizing techniques such as one-hot encoding and normalization.

3) Model Selection & Tuning:
  Compared models based on baseline performance and applied hyperparameter tuning to maximize predictive accuracy, deploying Random Forest for final evaluation given its robustness against overfitting.

4) Performance Evaluation:
   Focused on F1 Score and AUC-ROC metrics to balance precision and recall due to class imbalance.

# Results & Insights:-
 
 Achieved significant accuracy in predicting customer interest in term deposits, with Random Forest providing optimal results post-tuning.
Identified key demographic and behavioral factors associated with term deposit purchases, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.
